## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! I'm demonstrating my Session 03 homework submission for AIE8 - an End-to-End RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. This implementation allows users to upload PDF documents and chat with them using OpenAI's API, deployed on Vercel for production accessibility."

---

## System Overview (45 seconds)
"Let me show you the architecture:
- **Frontend**: Clean HTML interface with drag-and-drop PDF upload
- **Backend**: Flask application with CORS support for cross-origin requests
- **RAG Engine**: Custom implementation using OpenAI embeddings and text-davinci-003
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2 for text extraction from uploaded PDFs
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions for scalable hosting"

## Live Demonstration (3 minutes)

### PDF Upload Demo (1 minute)
"First, I'll upload a PDF document to demonstrate the system:
1. Navigate to the deployed application
2. Drag and drop a PDF file (or click to browse)
3. Show the upload progress and success confirmation
4. Explain that the system extracts text and creates embeddings for retrieval"

### Chat Functionality Demo (2 minutes)
"Now I'll demonstrate the RAG chat capabilities:

**Query 1**: 'What is this document about?'
- Show the system retrieving relevant context
- Display the AI-generated response based on document content

**Query 2**: 'Can you summarize the main points?'
- Demonstrate how RAG finds the most relevant sections
- Show coherent summary generation

**Query 3**: Ask a specific question related to document content
- Highlight precision of context retrieval
- Show how the system maintains conversation context"

---

## Technical Implementation Highlights (1 minute)
"Key technical features demonstrated:
- **Semantic Search**: Using cosine similarity for document chunk retrieval
- **Context Window Management**: Intelligent chunking to stay within token limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when documents can't be processed
- **Production Ready**: Deployed on Vercel with proper CORS and security headers
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices"

---

## Homework Compliance & Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This implementation satisfies all Session 03 requirements:
✓ End-to-end RAG system with document upload
✓ OpenAI integration for embeddings and chat completion
✓ Clean user interface for document interaction
✓ Production deployment on Vercel
✓ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

The system is live and ready for testing at the URL shown. Thank you for watching!"

## Demo Script Notes:
- Have a test PDF ready (ideally a technical document with clear sections)
- Test all functionality before recording
- Speak clearly and maintain good pacing
- Show both successful operations and error handling
- Highlight the seamless user experience from upload to chat
