## üéØ **SCRIPT (5 Minutes Total)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"Hi everyone! I'm Tyrone, and today I'm going to walk you through my Session 1 vibe check evaluation for the AI Engineer Challenge. I'll be demonstrating how I tested my AI chat application across different cognitive tasks and then improved it through system message enhancement."*

### **1. Project Overview (45 seconds)**
*"First, let me show you what I built - a full-stack AI chat application with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend. Here's the GitHub repository [show repo], and you can see I have both the backend API and frontend components. The app allows users to chat with different GPT models and customize the system message."*

*"For this vibe check, I tested the system across 5 different types of tasks to evaluate its capabilities and identify areas for improvement."*

### **2. Vibe Check Questions Overview (30 seconds)**
*"Let me show you the 5 questions I used for the vibe check [scroll through README]:*
- *Technical explanation (OOP concepts)*
- *Reading comprehension and summarization*
- *Creative writing (robot friendship story)*
- *Mathematical reasoning (apple/orange problem)*
- *Writing style adaptation (formal tone)*

*Plus a bonus question about the limitations of vibe checking itself."*

### **3. Before/After Comparison (2 minutes)**
*"Now, here's where it gets interesting. I tested each question twice - once with the default system message, and once with an enhanced system message that emphasizes scientific rigor and factual accuracy."*

*"Let me show you a few examples of the differences [scroll to Question 1]:*

**Before System Message Change:**
*[Read the "before" response - the more casual, friendly version]*

**After System Message Change:**
*[Read the "after" response - the more precise, scientific version]*

*"You can see how the enhanced system message made the responses more precise and scientifically rigorous while maintaining accessibility."*

*"Here's another example with the creative writing task [scroll to Question 3]:*

**Before:** *[Read the Jinx story - more whimsical]*
**After:** *[Read the R-17 story - more structured, thoughtful]*

*"The enhanced version shows more thoughtful character development and deeper themes."*

### **4. System Message Enhancement (45 seconds)**
*"The key change I made was updating the system message from 'You are a helpful AI assistant' to 'You are a helpful AI assistant. You are brutally honest, but kind. But you make sure everything you say is correct, scientifically validated, and true. You prioritise being factual and honest above everything.'"*

*"This simple change significantly improved performance across all tested aspects - from technical explanations to creative writing to mathematical reasoning."*

### **5. Results and Lessons Learned (45 seconds)**
*"The results were impressive. The system went from good to excellent across all categories. Key improvements included:*
- *Enhanced scientific rigor*
- *Better mathematical presentation with LaTeX notation*
- *More thoughtful creative writing*
- *Improved critical thinking and analysis*

*"Three key lessons I learned:*
1. *Vibe checking is valuable but has limitations - it's great for initial assessment but not comprehensive evaluation*
2. *AI systems show surprising versatility across diverse cognitive tasks*
3. *Evaluation methodology matters - how you test is as important as what you test*

*"Three things I haven't learned yet:*
1. *Systematic evaluation methods like automated testing*
2. *Production monitoring for AI systems*
3. *Comparative analysis using quantitative metrics"*

### **6. Live Demo (30 seconds)**
*"Let me quickly show you the app in action [open app if available]. Here's the interface where users can input their API key, select models, and customize the system message. The streaming chat interface provides real-time responses, and you can see how the system message affects the output quality."*

### **7. Closing (15 seconds)**
*"In conclusion, this vibe check revealed that prompt engineering can have a significant impact on AI system performance. The project is complete with full documentation, and I'm excited to continue building more sophisticated evaluation methods in future sessions. Thanks for watching!"*

## üé• **Recording Tips**

### **Screen Setup:**
- Split screen: GitHub README on left, live app on right
- Or alternate between full-screen views
- Make sure text is readable (zoom in if needed)

### **Speaking Tips:**
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Pause briefly between sections
- Use your hands to point to specific parts of the screen
- Smile and show enthusiasm for your work

### **Content Tips:**
- Don't read the entire responses - summarize and highlight key differences
- Focus on the most interesting before/after comparisons
- Keep the technical details accessible
- Show your personality and learning process
