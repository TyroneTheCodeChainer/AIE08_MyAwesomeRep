        "1. **Concurrency**: Multiple API calls can be made simultaneously rather than waiting for each one to complete sequentially. This dramatically reduces the total time needed to process large batches of documents.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Efficiency**: Instead of making 100 sequential API calls (which might take 100+ seconds), async allows us to make multiple calls concurrently, potentially reducing the total time to just 10-20 seconds depending on rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Resource utilization**: Better utilization of network resources and CPU time, as the program can handle multiple I/O operations simultaneously.\n",

        "2. **Top-p Parameter**: Use `top_p` (nucleus sampling) instead of or in combination with temperature for more controlled randomness.\n",

        "3. **Seed Parameter**: Use the `seed` parameter to get reproducible outputs across API calls. This ensures that the same input with the same seed will produce the same output.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stop Sequences**: Use `stop` parameter to control where the model stops generating, which can make outputs more predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Max Tokens**: Set `max_tokens` to control the maximum length of the response, ensuring consistent output length.\n",

            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO who previously excelled in a specific function or specialty ends up hiring a weak executive to run that same function after becoming CEO. This problem arises because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that originally established their success, and as a result, deliberately or inadvertently hires someone weak in that role so that the CEO can continue to be \"the man\" in that area. An example given is Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, who had been a brilliant TV network executive but when he bought ABC, the network fell to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had more time, he could have turned ABC around himself, illustrating his reluctance to fully relinquish control to a strong executive. This problem highlights the risk of undermining the function's leadership due to the CEO's grip on the area that made them successful ([Source 1]).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: This strategy involves asking the model to \"think step by step\" or \"show your reasoning process\" before providing the final answer. This encourages the model to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",

        "2. **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide examples of the desired response format and quality in the prompt, showing the model what a good response looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Role-Based Prompting**: Assign the model a specific expert role (e.g., \"You are a senior data scientist with 10 years of experience\") to encourage more authoritative and detailed responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Structured Output Formatting**: Ask for responses in specific formats like \"First, explain X. Then, provide examples. Finally, summarize the key points.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Meta-Cognitive Prompts**: Ask the model to reflect on its own reasoning (\"What are the key assumptions in this analysis?\" or \"What additional information would strengthen this answer?\").\n",
        "\n",
        "The most effective strategy for thoughtful responses is **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**, which explicitly asks the model to show its reasoning process before providing the final answer.\n"
