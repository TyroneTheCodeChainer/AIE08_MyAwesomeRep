# üåô Dream Interpretation RAG Assistant - Loom Video Script

## **Video Length: 4-5 minutes**

---

## **üé¨ OPENING (30 seconds)**

**"Hi everyone! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm excited to show you my Session 3 homework for the AI Engineer Challenge - a Dream Interpretation RAG Assistant that combines the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation with specialized dream analysis."**

**"This project demonstrates how to take a generic RAG system and customize it for a specific domain - in this case, sleep science and dream interpretation."**

---

## **üìã ACTIVITY #1 DEMONSTRATION (90 seconds)**

### **Show the Application (15 seconds)**
- **Navigate to:** https://the-ai-engineer-challenge-da8fir9uz-tyroneinozs-projects.vercel.app
- **"Here's my deployed application - notice the dream-themed UI with the moon icon and indigo color scheme."**

### **Demonstrate Core RAG Functionality (45 seconds)**
- **"Let me show you the core RAG functionality from Activity #1:"**
- **Click on settings (gear icon)**
- **"First, I'll enter my OpenAI API key"**
- **"Now I'll toggle on Dream Research Mode"**
- **"I'll upload a PDF - let me use this dream research paper"**
- **Show PDF upload process**
- **"The system is now indexing the PDF using the aimakerspace library"**
- **"Now I can chat with the PDF content"**
- **Type a question like: "What does this research say about REM sleep and dream content?"**
- **Show the RAG response**

### **Explain Technical Implementation (30 seconds)**
- **"This demonstrates the core RAG pipeline: PDF upload, document chunking, vector indexing, and semantic search."**
- **"The system only answers based on the uploaded PDF content, ensuring accuracy and preventing hallucination."**

## **üéØ ACTIVITY #2 DEMONSTRATION (90 seconds)**

### **Show Domain Customization (30 seconds)**
- **"Now for Activity #2 - I've customized this for dream interpretation:"**
- **"Notice the specialized UI with dream themes, moon icons, and indigo colors"**
- **"The placeholder text asks users to 'describe your dream for interpretation'"**
- **"The system message is customized for sleep science expertise"**

### **Demonstrate Dream Analysis (45 seconds)**
- **Switch to regular chat mode (toggle off RAG)**
- **"In regular mode, users can get general dream interpretations"**
- **Type: "I had a dream about flying over a city"**
- **Show the dream interpretation response**
- **"The AI provides scientifically-grounded interpretations based on sleep research"**

### **Show Research Integration (15 seconds)**
- **"When users upload research papers, the system can provide evidence-based dream analysis"**
- **"This combines personal dream descriptions with scientific literature"**

## **üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (60 seconds)**

### **Show Code Structure (30 seconds)**
- **"Let me quickly show the technical implementation:"**
- **Open GitHub repository**
- **"I created a feature branch following the global Cursor rules"**
- **"Here's the MERGE.md file with GitHub PR instructions"**
- **"The aimakerspace library is integrated for RAG functionality"**

### **Explain Architecture (30 seconds)**
- **"The backend uses FastAPI with PDF processing and vector search"**
- **"The frontend is Next.js with React for the UI"**
- **"Everything is deployed on Vercel for production"**
- **"The system maintains all core RAG functionality while adding domain specialization"**

## **üéØ HOMEWORK VALIDATION (30 seconds)**

**"Let me verify this meets all Session 3 requirements:"**

- **‚úÖ "Activity #1: RAG functionality with PDF upload and chat"**
- **‚úÖ "Activity #2: Specific use-case with UI customization"**
- **‚úÖ "Branch development with MERGE.md file"**
- **‚úÖ "Vercel deployment working in production"**
- **‚úÖ "Domain-specific customization for dream researchers and psychologists"**

---

## **üöÄ CLOSING (30 seconds)**

**"This project demonstrates how RAG can be customized for specific domains while maintaining core functionality."**

**"The dream interpretation theme shows how to think about target users - in this case, sleep researchers, psychologists, and people interested in scientifically-grounded dream analysis."**

**"The key takeaway is that RAG isn't just about technical implementation - it's about creating value for specific users and use cases."**

**"Thanks for watching! You can find the code on my GitHub repository and try the live application yourself."**

## **üìù SPEAKING TIPS:**

1. **Speak clearly and at a moderate pace**
2. **Point to specific UI elements when explaining**
3. **Show actual functionality, don't just describe it**
4. **Emphasize the domain customization aspect**
5. **Keep transitions smooth between sections**
6. **End with a clear call-to-action**
