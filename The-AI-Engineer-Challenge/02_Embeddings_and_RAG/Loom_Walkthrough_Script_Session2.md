## üéØ **SCRIPT (5 Minutes Total)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"Hi everyone! I'm Tyrone, and today I'm going to walk you through my Session 2 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) assignment. I'll be demonstrating how I built a complete RAG system from scratch and then enhanced it with advanced features like PDF support and metadata tracking."*

### **1. Project Overview (45 seconds)**
*"First, let me show you what I built - a comprehensive RAG system that can process both text and PDF documents. Here's the GitHub repository [show repo], and you can see I have the complete notebook with all 5 required tasks plus significant enhancements."*

*"The system uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for vectorization and GPT-4.1-mini for generation, with a custom vector database for similarity search."*

### **2. Core RAG Tasks Overview (30 seconds)**
*"Let me show you the 5 core tasks I completed [scroll through notebook]:*
- *Task 1: Imports and Utilities - Async processing setup*
- *Task 2: Documents - Document loading and processing classes*
- *Task 3: Embeddings and Vectors - Vector database implementation*
- *Task 4: Prompts - Context-aware prompt creation*
- *Task 5: Retrieval Augmented Generation - Complete RAG pipeline*

*Plus I answered all 4 required questions with detailed explanations."*

### **3. Activity #1 Enhancements (2 minutes)**
*"Now, here's where it gets exciting. For Activity #1, I significantly enhanced the RAG system with several key features:"*

**Enhanced Features:**
*"Let me show you the enhancements I added [scroll to Activity #1 section]:*

1. **PDF Support**: *"I integrated PyPDF2 to process PDF documents alongside text files, with page-by-page extraction and metadata tracking."*

2. **Metadata Tracking**: *"I enhanced the vector database to store source file information, file types, page numbers, and chunk indices for complete traceability."*

3. **Enhanced Citations**: *"Responses now include proper source references with file names, types, and page numbers for professional output."*

4. **Process Visualization**: *"I created a comprehensive Mermaid diagram showing the complete RAG workflow from document ingestion to response generation."*

*"Let me show you the process diagram [display diagram] - this shows how documents flow through the system with all the enhancements."*

### **4. Before/After Comparison (1 minute)**
*"Here's the real test - let me show you the difference between the original and enhanced systems [scroll to comparison section]:*

**Original System:**
*"Basic text processing, no metadata, limited citations"*

**Enhanced System:**
*"Full PDF support, complete metadata tracking, professional citations with source information"*

*"You can see the enhanced system provides much better traceability and professional output."*

### **5. Technical Implementation (45 seconds)**
*"The key technical improvements include:*
- *Async processing for better performance*
- *Enhanced vector database with metadata storage*
- *Improved prompt engineering with source attribution*
- *Modular design for easy extension*

*"I used cosine similarity for vector search and implemented proper error handling throughout."*

### **6. Live Demo (30 seconds)**
*"Let me quickly demonstrate the system in action [run a query if possible]. Here's how it processes a question about the 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' and returns a detailed answer with proper source citations and metadata."*

### **7. Closing (15 seconds)**
*"In conclusion, this RAG system demonstrates the power of combining retrieval with generation, enhanced with professional features like PDF support and metadata tracking. The project is complete with full documentation and ready for production use. Thanks for watching!"*
