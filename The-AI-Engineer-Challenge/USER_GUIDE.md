# ü§ñ AI-Powered RAG Chat System - User Guide

## üìñ What is This System?

This is an intelligent chat application that can:
- **Chat with AI**: Have conversations with an artificial intelligence assistant
- **Upload Documents**: Upload PDF files and ask questions about their content
- **Smart Answers**: Get intelligent responses based on your documents

Think of it as having a super-smart research assistant who can read your documents and answer questions about them!

## üéØ Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Part 1: Regular Chat with AI**

1. **Open the Application**
   - Go to the website or open the application
   - You'll see a chat interface

2. **Start Chatting**
   - Type your message in the text box at the bottom
   - Press Enter or click the Send button
   - The AI will respond in real-time

3. **Customize the AI**
   - Click the Settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) to open settings
   - Change the AI model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
   - Modify the AI's personality by editing the "System Message"
   - Add your own OpenAI API key (optional)

### **Part 2: Document-Based Chat (RAG Mode)**

1. **Enable Dream Research Mode**
   - Check the "Enable Document-Based Chat" checkbox
   - This switches the system to document mode

2. **Upload a PDF Document**
   - Click "Choose File" and select a PDF from your computer
   - Wait for the upload to complete
   - You'll see a success message with the filename

3. **Ask Questions About Your Document**
   - Type questions related to your uploaded PDF
   - The AI will search through your document and provide answers
   - Examples of good questions:
     - "What is the main topic of this document?"
     - "Summarize the key points"
     - "What does the document say about [specific topic]?"

4. **Switch Back to Regular Chat**
   - Uncheck "Enable Document-Based Chat"
   - Or click "Remove" next to your uploaded file

### **How RAG Works**

1. **Document Processing**
   - PDF is uploaded to the server
   - Text is extracted from the PDF
   - Text is broken into small chunks (1000 characters each)
   - Chunks are stored for searching

2. **Question Processing**
   - User asks a question
   - System searches through document chunks
   - Finds the most relevant chunks
   - Sends question + relevant chunks to AI
   - AI generates answer based on document content

3. **Response Generation**
   - AI creates an informed answer
   - Response is streamed back to user in real-time

### **API Endpoints**

- `GET /api/health` - Check if server is running
- `POST /api/chat` - Regular chat with AI
- `POST /api/upload-pdf` - Upload PDF documents
- `POST /api/rag-chat` - Ask questions about uploaded documents

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"API key is required" Error**
   - **Solution**: Add your OpenAI API key in settings, or the system will use the server's key

2. **PDF Upload Fails**
   - **Check**: Make sure the file is actually a PDF
   - **Check**: Ensure the PDF contains readable text (not just images)

3. **No Response from AI**
   - **Check**: Your internet connection
   - **Check**: The backend server status at `/api/health`

4. **RAG Mode Not Working**
   - **Check**: Make sure you've uploaded a PDF first
   - **Check**: The PDF contains text (not just images)
