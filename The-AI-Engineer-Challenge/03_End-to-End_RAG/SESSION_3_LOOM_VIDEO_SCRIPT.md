# Session 3: End-to-End RAG - Loom Video Script

## üé¨ **Video Title:** "Building a Full-Stack RAG Application with Dream Research Mode"

### **Video Duration:** 8-10 minutes

---

## üìù **Script Outline:**

### **Opening (0:00 - 0:30)**
**"Hi everyone! I'm Tyrone, and today I'm going to walk you through my Session 3 assignment where I built a complete end-to-end RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application with a specialized Dream Research Mode. This demonstrates how to take a basic RAG system and turn it into a production-ready full-stack application."**

### **1. Project Overview (0:30 - 1:30)**
**"Let me show you what we built. [Screen share: GitHub repository] Here's our AIE08_MyAwesomeRep repository with the complete Session 3 implementation. We have a FastAPI backend, a Next.js frontend, and a specialized Dream Research Mode that allows users to upload dream research papers and get scientifically-validated dream interpretations."**

**"The key components are:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with RAG endpoints for PDF upload and chat
- **Frontend**: Next.js with a beautiful, responsive UI
- **Specialized Use Case**: Dream Research Mode for psychological analysis
- **Deployment**: Everything deployed on Vercel"**

### **2. Backend Implementation (1:30 - 3:00)**
**"Let's dive into the backend first. [Screen share: api/app.py] Here's our FastAPI application with the SimpleRAG class that handles PDF processing and document retrieval."**

**"Key features:**
- **PDF Upload Endpoint**: `/api/upload-pdf` processes and indexes PDF files
- **RAG Chat Endpoint**: `/api/rag-chat` provides context-aware responses
- **Document Management**: Tracks uploaded documents and chunk counts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for production use"**

**"The RAG implementation uses text splitting, embedding generation, and similarity search to find relevant document chunks for each query."**

### **3. Frontend Implementation (3:00 - 5:00)**
**"Now let's look at the frontend. [Screen share: frontend/pages/index.tsx] This is where the magic happens with our Dream Research Mode."**

**"Key UI features:**
- **Dream Research Toggle**: Switch between normal chat and RAG mode
- **PDF Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress indicators
- **Specialized System Message**: Focused on dream interpretation and psychology
- **Status Indicators**: Shows when PDFs are uploaded and indexed
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices"**

**"The frontend integrates seamlessly with our backend APIs and provides real-time feedback to users."**

### **4. Dream Research Mode Demo (5:00 - 7:00)**
**"Let me demonstrate the Dream Research Mode in action. [Screen share: Live application]**

**"Step 1: I'll toggle on Dream Research Mode
Step 2: Upload a dream research paper PDF
Step 3: Ask a question about dream interpretation
Step 4: Get a scientifically-validated response based on the uploaded research"**

**"This demonstrates how RAG can be specialized for specific use cases, making it incredibly powerful for domain-specific applications."**

### **5. Deployment and Production Features (7:00 - 8:30)**
**"Everything is deployed and working in production. [Screen share: Vercel dashboard]**

**"Production features:**
- **Vercel Deployment**: Both frontend and backend deployed
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and reliability"**

### **6. Key Learnings and Next Steps (8:30 - 9:30)**
**"This project taught me several important concepts:**

**"Technical Learnings:**
- How to build production-ready RAG systems
- Full-stack integration between FastAPI and Next.js
- Specialized use case implementation
- Deployment best practices"**

**"The code is all available in the repository, and I've included comprehensive documentation for anyone who wants to understand or extend this system."**

### **Closing (9:30 - 10:00)**
**"Thanks for watching! This Session 3 assignment demonstrates how to take RAG from a simple concept to a production-ready application. The Dream Research Mode shows how we can specialize RAG for specific domains, making it incredibly powerful for real-world applications."**

**"Check out the repository for the complete code and documentation. See you in the next session!"**
