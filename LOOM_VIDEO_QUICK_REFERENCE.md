## üéØ **Common Success Factors**

### **For Both Videos:**
1. **Show, Don't Just Tell** - Always demonstrate actual functionality
2. **Be Specific** - Mention exact numbers, names, and technical details
3. **Connect to Requirements** - Explicitly state how each demo meets assignment requirements
4. **Keep It Flowing** - Practice transitions between sections
5. **Stay Within Time** - Keep videos under 6 minutes total

### **Technical Demonstration Tips:**
- Use full screen for clear visibility
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Highlight code sections as you explain them
- Show actual working functionality, not just code
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions

### **Backup Plans:**
- Have screenshots ready if live demos fail
- Test all URLs before recording
- Have local versions ready as fallbacks
- Practice the script to ensure smooth delivery

## üìù **Pre-Recording Checklist**

### **Session 3:**
- [ ] Test live application functionality
- [ ] Verify PDF upload works
- [ ] Test both RAG and regular chat modes
- [ ] Check GitHub repository accessibility
- [ ] Prepare sample PDF for demonstration

### **Session 4:**
- [ ] Ensure Jupyter notebook is fully executed
- [ ] Verify all code cells have outputs
- [ ] Check that requirements are marked as completed
- [ ] Test QDrant connection (if possible)
- [ ] Prepare code examples for highlighting

## üé¨ **Recording Environment Setup**

1. **Screen Resolution:** Use 1920x1080 or higher
2. **Browser:** Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility
3. **Audio:** Test microphone and speak clearly
4. **Lighting:** Ensure good visibility of screen content
5. **Internet:** Stable connection for live demos
6. **Backup:** Have offline versions ready

Remember: The goal is to demonstrate not just that you completed the assignments, but that you understand the underlying concepts and can explain them clearly to others!
