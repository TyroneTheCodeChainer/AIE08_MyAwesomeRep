## üéØ **Opening (30 seconds)**

### **Script:**
"Hello! I'm Tyrone, and today I'm demonstrating my Session 4 assignment: Production RAG with LCEL and LangGraph. This session focuses on building production-ready RAG systems using LangChain's advanced components.

I'll show you how I've implemented sophisticated document chunking strategies, built robust LCEL pipelines with error handling, and created intelligent LangGraph workflows for state management. Let me walk you through the complete implementation."

---

## üöÄ **Main Demonstration (4-5 minutes)**

### **1. Jupyter Notebook Demonstration (3-4 minutes)**

#### **Navigate to the Notebook:**
"Let me open the completed assignment notebook. I'll navigate to the Session 4 directory:"

**üîó URL to show:** `https://github.com/TyroneTheCodeChainer/AIE08_MyAwesomeRep/tree/s04-assignment/04_Production_RAG`

#### **Script:**
"Here's the Assignment_Introduction_to_LCEL_and_LangGraph_LangChain_Powered_RAG.ipynb notebook. Notice the completion status at the top - this shows that all requirements have been met."

#### **Question #1 - Embedding Dimensions:**
"Let me show you Question #1. I was asked about the embedding dimensions for the embeddinggemma model.

*[Navigate to Question #1 section]*

Here's my answer: **768 dimensions**. The embeddinggemma model produces 768-dimensional vectors, which is a standard size for many embedding models. This dimension choice balances representation quality with computational efficiency."

#### **Activity #1 - Advanced Chunking Strategies:**
"Now let me show Activity #1, where I implemented three sophisticated chunking strategies:

*[Navigate to Activity #1 section]*

**Strategy 1: Semantic Chunking Based on Topic Boundaries**
```python
def semantic_chunking(text, topic_threshold=0.7):
    # Use NLP techniques to identify topic shifts
    # Split at natural semantic boundaries
    # Preserve context and meaning
```

**Strategy 2: Hierarchical Chunking**
```python
def hierarchical_chunking(document):
    # Split into larger sections first (chapters)
    # Recursively split sections into smaller chunks
    # Maintain document structure
```

**Strategy 3: Overlap-based Chunking with Dynamic Sizing**
```python
def dynamic_overlap_chunking(text, base_size=500, overlap=50):
    # Split into fixed-size chunks with configurable overlap
    # Dynamically adjust size based on content density
    # Ensure no information is lost at boundaries
```

These strategies address different content types and use cases, making the RAG system more robust."

#### **Question #2 - Error Handling and Fact-checking:**
"Let me show Question #2, where I addressed handling no relevant context and fact-checking:

*[Navigate to Question #2 section]*

**For No Relevant Context:**
- Implement confidence scoring for retrieved documents
- Provide fallback responses when confidence is low
- Guide users to refine their queries
- Log low-confidence interactions for improvement

**For Fact-checking:**
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Implement source verification
- Use confidence thresholds for assertions
- Provide uncertainty indicators in responses

This ensures the system maintains reliability even when information is scarce or conflicting."

#### **LCEL Pipeline Implementation:**
"Now let me show the LCEL pipeline implementation:

*[Navigate to LCEL section]*

```python
# LCEL Pipeline with Error Handling
rag_pipeline = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(
        context=retriever | RunnableLambda(format_docs)
    )
    | prompt
    | llm
    | RunnableLambda(validate_response)
    | RunnableLambda(handle_errors)
)
```

This pipeline includes:
- Document retrieval and formatting
- Prompt engineering
- LLM processing
- Response validation
- Comprehensive error handling

The beauty of LCEL is its composability and built-in error handling."

#### **LangGraph Workflow:**
"Let me show the LangGraph implementation for state management:

*[Navigate to LangGraph section]*

```python
# LangGraph State Management
def create_rag_graph():
    workflow = StateGraph(RAGState)
    
    # Add nodes
    workflow.add_node("retrieve", retrieve_documents)
    workflow.add_node("generate", generate_response)
    workflow.add_node("validate", validate_response)
    workflow.add_node("fallback", handle_no_context)
    
    # Add edges with conditions
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "retrieve",
        should_generate_response,
        {
            "generate": "generate",
            "fallback": "fallback"
        }
    )
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

This creates an intelligent workflow that can:
- Retrieve relevant documents
- Generate responses when context is available
- Fall back gracefully when no context is found
- Validate responses before returning them"

#### **QDrant Integration:**
"Finally, let me show the QDrant vector database integration:

*[Navigate to QDrant section]*

```python
# QDrant Vector Database Setup
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from langchain_qdrant import QdrantVectorStore

# Initialize QDrant
client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)
vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name="rag_documents",
    embeddings=embedding_model
)
```

This provides:
- Efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Scalable similarity search
- Metadata filtering capabilities
- Production-ready performance"

### **2. Code Implementation Highlights (1-2 minutes)**

#### **Error Handling Demonstration:**
"Let me show you the comprehensive error handling I've implemented:

*[Navigate to error handling section]*

```python
class RAGErrorHandler:
    def handle_no_context(self, query, confidence_scores):
        if max(confidence_scores) < 0.3:
            return {
                "response": "I couldn't find relevant information for your query. Please try rephrasing or providing more context.",
                "confidence": "low",
                "suggestions": self._generate_suggestions(query)
            }
    
    def handle_rate_limits(self, error):
        return "The system is experiencing high demand. Please try again in a moment."
    
    def handle_context_overflow(self, context_length):
        return "The context is too long. Please try a more specific query."
```

This ensures the system gracefully handles various failure modes."

#### **Production Monitoring:**
"Here's the monitoring and logging implementation:

*[Navigate to monitoring section]*

```python
# Production Monitoring
class RAGMonitor:
    def log_interaction(self, query, response, confidence, response_time):
        self.metrics.update({
            "total_queries": self.metrics.get("total_queries", 0) + 1,
            "avg_confidence": self._update_avg_confidence(confidence),
            "avg_response_time": self._update_avg_response_time(response_time)
        })
    
    def check_health(self):
        return {
            "status": "healthy" if self.metrics["avg_confidence"] > 0.7 else "degraded",
            "metrics": self.metrics
        }
```

This provides real-time monitoring of system performance and quality."
