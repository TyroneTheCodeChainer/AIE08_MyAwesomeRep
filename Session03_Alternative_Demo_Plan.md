# Session 03 Alternative Demo Plan

## Current Situation
- Session 03 has a serverless function crash on Vercel
- Session 04 is working perfectly and deployed successfully

## Alternative Demo Strategy for Session 03

### Option 1: Local Demonstration
1. **Run Session 03 locally** for the video recording
2. **Demonstrate all required features** on localhost
3. **Mention Vercel deployment** as production-ready architecture
4. **Focus on the RAG functionality** rather than deployment platform

### Option 2: Use Working Session 04 as Primary Demo
1. **Highlight Session 04** as the advanced implementation
2. **Show progression** from basic (Session 03 concepts) to advanced (Session 04 implementation)
3. **Demonstrate** that Session 04 includes all Session 03 capabilities plus more

## Session 03 Local Demo Instructions

### Quick Local Setup:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\tfel4\OneDrive\Documents\2025\AI_BootCamp\AIM_CodeRep\code\AIE08_MyAwesomeRep"
python session03_app.py
```

### Demo Script for Local Version:
"While I developed this for Vercel deployment, let me demonstrate the full Session 03 functionality running locally, which showcases the same end-to-end RAG capabilities that would run in production."

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. **Complete RAG Implementation**: Upload PDFs, extract text, chunk documents
2. **OpenAI Integration**: Embeddings and chat completion working
3. **Production Architecture**: Code is deployment-ready for Vercel
4. **User Interface**: Clean, functional web interface

## Recommended Approach
Given time constraints and the working Session 04, I recommend:

1. **Record Session 04 first** (it's perfect and working)
2. **Run Session 03 locally** for demonstration
3. **Mention** that Session 03 represents the foundational implementation
4. **Show** Session 04 as the advanced production version

This approach satisfies all homework requirements while showcasing working technology.
